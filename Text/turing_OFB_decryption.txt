Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (23 June 1912 7 June 1954) was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, 
cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.[5] He was highly influential in the development of theoretical 
computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, 
which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.[6][7][8] Turing is widely considered to be the father 
of theoretical computer science.[9]

Born in London, Turing was raised in southern England. He graduated from King's College, Cambridge, and in 1938, 
earned a doctorate degree from Princeton University. During World War II, Turing worked for the Government Code and 
Cypher School at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence. He led Hut 8, 
the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Turing devised techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, 
including improvements to the pre-war Polish bomba method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for 
the Enigma machine. He played a crucial role in cracking intercepted messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the 
Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic
