Deep Blue was a chess-playing expert system run on a unique purpose-built IBM supercomputer. It was the first computer 
to win a game, and the first to win a match, against a reigning world champion under regular time controls. Development 
began in 1985 at Carnegie Mellon University under the name ChipTest. It then moved to IBM, where it was first renamed 
Deep Thought, then again in 1989 to Deep Blue. It first played world champion Garry Kasparov in a six-game match in 1996, 
where it lost four games to two. It was upgraded in 1997 and in a six-game re-match, it defeated Kasparov by winning two 
games and drawing three. Deep Blue's victory is considered a milestone in the history of artificial intelligence and has 
been the subject of several books and films.

History
While a doctoral student at Carnegie Mellon University, Feng-hsiung Hsu began development of a chess-playing supercomputer 
under the name ChipTest. The machine won the North American Computer Chess Championship in 1987 and Hsu and his team 
followed up with a successor, Deep Thought, in 1988.[2][3] After receiving his doctorate in 1989, Hsu and Murray Campbell 
joined IBM Research to continue their project to build a machine that could defeat a world chess champion.[4] Their 
colleague Thomas Anantharaman briefly joined them at IBM before leaving for the finance industry and being replaced by 
programmer Arthur Joseph Hoane.[5][6] Jerry Brody, a long-time employee of IBM Research, subsequently joined the team 
in 1990.[7]

After Deep Thought's two-game 1989 loss to Kasparov, IBM held a contest to rename the chess machine: the winning name was 
"Deep Blue", submitted by Peter Fitzhugh Brown,[8] was a play on IBM's nickname, "Big Blue".[a] After a scaled-down 
version of Deep Blue played Grandmaster Joel Benjamin,[10] Hsu and Campbell decided that Benjamin was the expert they 
were looking for to help develop Deep Blue's opening book, so hired him to assist with the preparations for Deep Blue's 
matches against Garry Kasparov.[11] In 1995, a Deep Blue prototype played in the eighth World Computer Chess Championship, 
playing Wchess to a draw before ultimately losing to Fritz in round five, despite playing as White.[12]

Today, one of the two racks that made up Deep Blue is held by the National Museum of American History, having previously 
been displayed in an exhibit about the Information Age,[13] while the other rack was acquired by the Computer History 
Museum in 1997, and is displayed in the Revolution exhibit's "Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" gallery.[14] Several
 books were written about Deep Blue, among them Behind Deep Blue: Building the Computer that Defeated the World Chess 
 Champion by Deep Blue developer Feng-hsiung Hsu.[15]
